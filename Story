Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey on a berry tree, 
which was on the banks of the river. In the same forest, there lived a 
crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted
monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, 
as days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
This is for test.
